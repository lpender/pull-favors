Chrome Extension to re-order Pull Requests.

Feature specs come first.

File specs are placed adjacent to files.

Currently, feature specs have index of "feature", other specs match file name
with "_spec" appended to the end.

[Install](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pull-favors/eekfnkibgmemnnbbmdglmjabjdfdjglj) it from the Chrome Webstore.
