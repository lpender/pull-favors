About
----

Pull Favors re-orders your RSpec pull requests so that they are more readable.

It places feature-specs first.

It places other specs next to the files that they test.

It expects feature specs to be in `spec/features`.

Other specs should correspond to the files they test in the following way:

`app/folder/file.rb` => `spec/folder/file_spec.rb`
